ITEC 6301 Design Using Technology 

Assignment Description: 

Develop a prototype for learning to some degree

**Statement of empathy. Who will this prototype benefit from? What problem are you solving?**

My prototype would be creating a social app to help teachers in communicating with students more often through text or video chat and allow teachers to provide students with individualized instruction and feedback. Some of the problems are lack of communication between teachers and students but also failure in recognizing student progress and not providing more individualized feedback and personalized content for students. I used Figma to create my prototype design. 

**Prototype Goals (1-2 goals)**

To allow students to communicate and collaborate in groups and teachers to track and check progress of student group interactions
To enhance the frequency of interaction between teacher and student 


**Objectives (1-2 actionable and measurable objectives) **

To research and find ways teachers can use the social app to interact and communicate with their students 
To demonstrate how teachers can view their student group interactions on the social app


**Select one of the Instructional Design Models to use in your planning process. Name it and describe why you selected it. (1 paragraph)**

- Rapid Prototyping 
I chose Rapid Prototyping (RP) as my Instructional Design Models to use in my planning process. Due to its more non-linear and flexible approach, it made sense to use the RP model, which is commonly used across many fields. With technology constantly advancing forward, many educators across the world are seeking ways to interact with their students but have trouble communicating with them. 
RP would be the feasible design model to use in my planning process since the model is flexible and iterative, which would mean that I can go back and revise what needs to be done. RP allows the design and development phases to occur simultaneously while the evaluation is completed throughout the model process (Camm, 2012). The ultimate goal is to enhance communication and student learning by creating a prototype that is accessible and doesn't waste time. 


**Select one of the learning perspectives (behaviorist, cognitivist, constructivist, or another type discussed in class) to focus your solution or prototype.  Explain why you are using this learning perspective while you plan your prototype.** (1 paragraph)

I have decided to go with the constructivist learning style since it is centered on the students and advocates for active learning. As a Gen Z myself, I find constructivist learning to be the most beneficial in my learning since I can base it off of my own experiences and past knowledge (Nicholas, 2020). When I learn something passively, I am not able to retain the information very well. Many students who are Gen Z and Alpha like to utilize social apps to not only communicate with family and friends but also expand their learning and check their progress (Metallo et al., 2021). One prime example has been Youtube. Nowadays it is Tik-Tok, which has been on the rise recently. Many use it for personal and entertainment use; however, some find it as a way to understand a particular concept or subject learned from school or to enlighten their knowledge.
